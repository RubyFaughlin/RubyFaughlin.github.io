            <h2>Completed University Projects</h2>
            <p>These are a collection of projects that I have created throughout my major (Food Technology) and minor (Design in Timber) units.</p>

                    <H1>Food Technology</H1> 
                    <p> Pursuing Food Technology at university has given me the opportunity to explore the science, creativity, and innovation behind food. Through my studies, I’ve developed skills in product design, sustainability, nutrition, and consumer-focused research. These projects reflect not only my knowledge and technical ability, but also my passion for creating meaningful food solutions that respond to real-world needs.

                    <H1>Design in Timber</H1> 
                    <p> Pursuing Design in Timber at university has given me the opporunity to explore the intersection between creativity and functionality whilst providing me with a strong foundation in material science, sustainability and problem-solving.</p>
                    <p> I am grateful that I was able to experience this unit as perviously, as I previously had no experience in the topic and it has allowed me to develop valuable new skills that I will be able to pass onto my future students. </p>

                    <h3>LOW STOOL</h3>
                    <p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Design and produce a unique low stool for sale in the Taronga Zoo merchandise shop, inspired by the zoo's natural environment and commitment to conservation. </p>
                    <p> The design of this stool is based off the rock patterns that form naturally along the rocky coastlines of Australia, and in particular, Wollongong. The stool is designed to tell a story of our ancestors and how we are shaped (like the coastline) by those before us.</p>

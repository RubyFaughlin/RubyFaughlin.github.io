         <section>   
            <p>I am a passionate and student-focused educator, committed to creating inclusive and engaging learning experiences. My teaching blends curriculum alignment with practical application, encouraging students to connect theory with real-world contexts.</p>
            <p>I value creativity, critical thinking, and cultural responsiveness, and I bring these to life by designing hands-on, collaborative projects that challenge students to explore, analyse, and create meaningful solutions rooted in real-world and culturally inclusive contexts. </p>

            <p>My teaching philosophy is <i><strong>shaped by making sense of chaos. </strong> </i> </p>
            <p>Working in practical and fast-paced environments such as Food Technology kitchens and Industrial workshops has taught me that learning thrives in dynamic, hands-on settings where adaptability and problem-solving are essential. </p>
            <p>I believe that structured guidance within these busy spaces provides students with the confidence to take creative risks, develop resilience, and build real-world skills that so many contemporary individuals are missing.</p>
            <p>By embracing the organised chaos of practical learning, I aim to create an engaging, supportive environment where students can transform challenges into opportunities for growth.</p>

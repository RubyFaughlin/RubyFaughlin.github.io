 <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Ruby Faughlin</strong>,
        </section>
 <p>I am a <i>third-year</i> student teacher currently studying a Bachelor of 
    Education (Secondary) / Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and 
    Technologies) at Australian Catholic University. 
<p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in <i>inclusive, creative, and hands-on</i> learning, where students 
    are encouraged to take ownership of their learning through meaningful, 
    real-world experiences. </p>
</p> Outside the classroom, I’m a passionate traveller. 
    I also love sports and play rugby league, which fuels my belief in 
    teamwork and resilience both on and off the field. At home, I share life with 
    my cheeky Labrador puppy, <i>Ryobi</i>, who keeps me on my toes and reminds me to 
    enjoy the little things.</a></p>

    <h2>My Teaching Experience</h2>
<p>I’ve successfully completed three teaching practicums—two in public schools and one in a Catholic school. 
<p>Each placement has helped shape my understanding of how different learning environments operate and reaffirmed the importance of adaptability, relationship-building, and reflective practice in the classroom. </p>
</p>These experiences have also deepened my confidence in lesson planning, classroom management, and differentiation to meet a diverse range of student needs.</p>

<p> I’m majoring in <strong>Food Technology</strong>, an area I’m truly passionate about. I love learning and teaching about food, nutrition, and sustainability, and exploring how food connects to culture, health, and innovation. 
</p> Some of my most recent work includes developing a raspberry and beetroot protein bar designed to support active lifestyles, and creating a gourmet sausage range that celebrates the unique flavours of native Indigenous ingredients, including crocodile and kangaroo. Projects like these reflect my commitment to using food education as a tool to spark curiosity, respect for culture, and critical thinking in students.</p>
